            <div class="col-9 tAl ">You can probably figure out on your own that a “Chick” is a girl and and “Chuck” is a boy. But the history behind it goes back to when Cathy was a little girl. Her mother, Shirley, would always refer to her and her sister Cheryl as Chicks.
                And in 1997 her mother passed away. Grief stricken Cathy and Cheryl wanted a way to be able to incorporate their mother in their everyday lives. So they began calling each other “Chick”, and it just stuck. So when Cathy started her organization
                she wanted to call it “Chicks”. But with the support of her family and friends, she realized that there was quite a few men, that would not take kindly to being referred to as “Chicks” so that is where she came up with “Chucks”. And that
                is how we came to be known as “Chicks & Chucks”. In 2006, Cathy’s “Chicks and Chucks”, became a non-profit, 501 (c) (3) organization.</div>

            <div class="col-6 pr-5 ">On August 6, 2001 my life changed forever. Never would I imagine this path GOD has designed for me. On that day, I was diagnosed with breast cancer – and that is when the transformation took place. Upon hearing the paralyzing word “CANCER”,
                my life changed forever. I had no idea just how incredible the journey would be. My sister/best friend reminded me of a phrase our Mom would always say, “This has happened for a reason”!!! At that point I asked GOD to give me a second
                chance and I vowed to HIM that I would dedicate the rest of my life to help others battling this same terrible disease. HE certainly answered my prayer and now it is my turn to live up to that vow. Thus the creation of CHICKS & CHUCKS.
                We are an incredible group of hard working, compassionate, caring, loving, committed and AMAZING Chicks and Chucks (guys). Our group truly embraces the bond we have. We use our positive energy to raise money to supply products and services
                for breast cancer patients/survivors in our own communities. Chicks & Chucks was created in 2005. We became non-profit on July 18, 2006 and have never looked back- only forward! We are truly blessed because our family members and their
                spouses/friends complete our circle of strength and determination. Chick & Chucks has grown and expanded each year. We have been able to help more people each year because of our dedicated supporters. We are a dedicated group, with dedicated
                supporters trying to make a difference in our local communities.</div>

            <div class="col-6 pr-5 ">When my sister, Cathy “Chick” Youtsey-Halloran, was diagnosed with breast cancer in August of 2001, she made a vow to God that if he restored her health, she would do everything within her power to help others fighting this dreaded disease.
                I was by her side every step of the way — from being diagnosed, through surgeries, through completion of her chemo treatments. While fighting breast cancer, there were many, many days that she physically could not get up from the couch;
                to walk 10 steps to her front door was unimaginable. But through her incredible faith in God, her family and her friends, she persevered. To see her now, so energetic and full of life; fulfilling her vow to God and having a true and genuine
                passion for what she does is such an inspiration to me, and to the volumes of others that she has helped. I thank God every day for restoring my sister’s health, and I also thank God every day for the wonderful women who have joined our
                Board of Directors because Chicks & Chucks would never have been able to reach the magnitude that this organization has accomplished without them. They are all true angels from heaven – all of whom are my extended “sisters”!</div>

                asked me to become a Chick in 2005. That year her goal was to raise $50,000. Cathy’s enthusiasm and energy are infectious and after working with the Chicks for a few months I was hooked! Growing up I never had a sister and thanks to Cathy
                and Chicks & Chucks, now I have many!

            <div class="col-12 px-3 text-center ">On August 6, 2001 my life changed forever. Never would I imagine this path GOD has designed for me. On that day, I was diagnosed with breast cancer – and that is when the transformation took place. Upon hearing the paralyzing word “CANCER”,
                my life changed forever. I had no idea just how incredible the journey would be. My sister/best friend reminded me of a phrase our Mom would always say, “This has happened for a reason”!!! At that point I asked GOD to give me a second
                chance and I vowed to HIM that I would dedicate the rest of my life to help others battling this same terrible disease. HE certainly answered my prayer and now it is my turn to live up to that vow. Thus the creation of CHICKS & CHUCKS.
                We are an incredible group of hard working, compassionate, caring, loving, committed and AMAZING Chicks and Chucks (guys). Our group truly embraces the bond we have. We use our positive energy to raise money to supply products and services
                for breast cancer patients/survivors in our own communities. Chicks & Chucks was created in 2005. We became non-profit on July 18, 2006 and have never looked back- only forward! We are truly blessed because our family members and their
                spouses/friends complete our circle of strength and determination. Chick & Chucks has grown and expanded each year. We have been able to help more people each year because of our dedicated supporters. We are a dedicated group, with dedicated
                supporters trying to make a difference in our local communities.</div>

                I could not think of anything I would rather be doing. It is a way of paying forward the blessings that I have in my life. Each of the Chicks and Chucks board members bring their own unique abilities and viewpoints to our organization.
                It is a gift to be part of this organization and being able to work with the board members and their family who support the Chicks and Chucks’ mission.</div>

            <div class="col-12 px-3 text-center ">When my sister, Cathy “Chick” Youtsey-Halloran, was diagnosed with breast cancer in August of 2001, she made a vow to God that if he restored her health, she would do everything within her power to help others fighting this dreaded disease.
                I was by her side every step of the way — from being diagnosed, through surgeries, through completion of her chemo treatments. While fighting breast cancer, there were many, many days that she physically could not get up from the couch;
                to walk 10 steps to her front door was unimaginable. But through her incredible faith in God, her family and her friends, she persevered. To see her now, so energetic and full of life; fulfilling her vow to God and having a true and genuine
                passion for what she does is such an inspiration to me, and to the volumes of others that she has helped. I thank God every day for restoring my sister’s health, and I also thank God every day for the wonderful women who have joined our
                Board of Directors because Chicks & Chucks would never have been able to reach the magnitude that this organization has accomplished without them. They are all true angels from heaven – all of whom are my extended “sisters”!</div>

                asked me to become a Chick in 2005. That year her goal was to raise $50,000. Cathy’s enthusiasm and energy are infectious and after working with the Chicks for a few months I was hooked! Growing up I never had a sister and thanks to Cathy

                same boat as she was, she understands the concerns and needs of a woman or man who has breast cancer. On a more selfish note, I enjoy the entire group who volunteers their time and talent to the organization; we have way too much fun.
                Besides it has now become a family group, all our husbands, children and other extended family members have become involved in the organization and will help it to continue for a long time.</div>
